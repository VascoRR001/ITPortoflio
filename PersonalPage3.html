        <aside>
          <p>I am Bernard Amofa, I was born on december 17, 1979 in Kumasi, Ghana, West Africa. I was raised and spent almost all my life in this lovely city.</p>
          <p>I had my elementary school, secondary school, polytechnic, and university education all in Kumasi, Ghana.</p>
          <p>I decided to change my environment and explore other areas and cultures, so I am currently having my master degree program in the Czech Republic where I am studying Computer Science in the department of Systems Engineering and Computer Science in the Faculty of Economics and Management. </p>
          <p>It was always my wish to get a profession in web development and I think this semester was the starting point.</p>
          <p>I am so happy.</p>
