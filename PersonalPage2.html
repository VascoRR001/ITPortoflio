              <p>My name is Tiago Lameirão, I was born on July 9th, 2001 in Vila Real, Portugal. I was born and raised in this beautiful Portuguese city and I'm currently a university student. I'm a third year bachelor student of Computer Use at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD) but during this semester I am studying at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.</p>
              <p>My path has always been connected to sports. I started playing sports in basketball, followed by swimming, reaching competition level, but it was in football where I felt more fulfilled and where I stayed longer, going through all the training levels.</p>
              <p>I awakened to volunteering in 2019 and since then I perform duties at Refood of Vila Real, providing rescued food to those in need at no cost to the beneficiaries.</p>
              <p>I am humble, resilient, organized, with a huge desire to learn and conquer new paths.</p>
