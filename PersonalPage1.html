        <h1>Vasco Ribeiro</h1>
        <aside>
          <p>I am Vasco Rodrigues Ribeiro, I am from Vila Real, Portugal and I was born on July 7, 2001 . Since I was born I have lived in Vila Real and I am currently a university student. I'm in my last year of my bachelor's degree in Computer Use at the "Universidade de Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro" (UTAD), but during this semester I'm studying at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague.</p>
          <p>It was my intention to do ERASMUS this semester not only so that I can acquire new knowledge in my area of study and future area of work, but also to get to know new cultures, learn new languages and get out of my comfort zone.</p>
          <p>I have always been a rather introverted, very friendly, sporty and above all studious person.</p>
          <p>Since my childhood I have shown interest in everything related to technologies, one of the reasons was growing up playing video games, and since then I have acquired knowledge about everything to do with technologies, from hardware to software, the milestones that revolutionized the development of computer science until today.</p>
          <p>I started getting into programming around the age of 16/17, where I ended up learning to work in Visual Basic.</p>
          <p>In the near future, it is my intention to enter a master's degree in the same area.</p>
